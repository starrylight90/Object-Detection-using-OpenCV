# Object-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project used OpenCV libraries 
The most useful was MobileNet-SSD v3 (see #16760) model from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API
It had 80 labels and was very interesting to work with.
OpenCV has a large scale implementation and my project here contained three phases of object detections: <b><br>1. Image based Object Detection <br>2. Video Input based Oject Detection <br>3. Webcam Based Object Detection </b>
