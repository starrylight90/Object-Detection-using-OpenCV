# Object-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project used OpenCV libraries 
The most useful was MobileNet-SSD v3 (see #16760) model from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API <br>
It had 80 labels and those labels are stored in the <a href = "https://github.com/starrylight90/Object-Detection-using-OpenCV/blob/main/Labels.txt">Labels.txt</a> file. It was fascinating to work with.
OpenCV has a large scale implementation and my project here contained three phases of object detections: <b><br>1. Image-based Object Detection <br>2. Video Input based Object Detection <br>3. Webcam-Based Object Detection </b>
